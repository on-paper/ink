## Introduction

Paper is a minimalistic decentralized ethereum-native social platform. 
Paper allows you to maintain full control over your identity and data and take it with you anywhere.

Powered by Ethereum Comments Protocol (ECP), ensuring your discussions are permanent and uncensorable.
Using Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP), your connections follow you across the decentralized web.
All attachments (like images, videos, etc.) are stored on decentralized storage networks like Grove, IPFS and Arweave, ensuring permanence and ownership of your data.

Enjoy Web3 benefits without constant transaction fees through our gasless transaction system powered by ECP.

## Why now? 

We have scaled Ethereum enough to be able to afford to use L2 blocks as our DA layer for the most decentralized social in the world. 
All contracts that paper uses can be deployed on any EVM-compatible chain and work seamlessly.
This makes paper the most secure, permanent and decentralized social network in the world from day 1.
