# Your Social Graph on Paper

Ethereum Follow Protocol lets you own your social connections and take them to any compatible platform.

<Callout type="info">
**TLDR**: With EFP Your follower list becomes portable data that you own, not locked to any single platform.

## What is EFP?

EFP is a protocol that stores your social connections (who you follow, who follows you) on the blockchain. Think of it as a universal follower list that works across multiple apps.

On traditional social media, your followers are locked to that platform. If you leave or get banned, you lose everything. With EFP, your connections are stored **independently from any single platform**. Switch platforms, keep your network.

## Why Paper Chose EFP

### Interoperability
Build your network once on Paper, use it on any other EFP-enabled app. Your followers automatically carry over.

### True Ownership
Your follower list is under your control. No platform can delete it or lock you out of it.

## Getting Started

If you're using Paper, you're already building your social graph. Every follow is automatically recorded in EFP.
