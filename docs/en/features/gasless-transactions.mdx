# Gasless Transactions


The [ECP](/docs/protocols/ecp) protocol implements an approvals system that allows comment authors to delegate 
the ability for an app to post comments on their behalf. This enables a smooth UX where a user signs a one-time 
approval transaction, and the app can post comments on their behalf without requiring the user to sign each comment. 
These approvals can be revoked by the user at any time.

Paper implements ECP gasless transactions to remove friction from user interactions.

You can approve transactions on Paper to be sponsored by Paper. This means you can post on Paper without needing to pay gas fees.

## How to use it

1. Go to [settings](/settings)
2. Scroll to "Gasless Posting"
3. Choose a period of time to approve transactions for
4. Sign an approval transaction (you'll pay gas once for this approval)

After that, Paper will cover the gas fees for your posts, and you can revoke the approval whenever you like.
