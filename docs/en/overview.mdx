## Introduction

Paper is the most secure and decentralized social network **in the world**.
Paper allows you to maintain **full control** over your identity, connections and content and take them with you anywhere.

Paper is [open-source software](https://github.com/on-paper/ink). We welcome you to join us in building the future of social networking - one that's open, transparent, and truly belongs to its users.

## Why now? 

Decentralized social networks of the past aimed for *sufficient* decentralization, having to take tradeoffs (on speed, cost or security) in order to make it work.

Today, we have the ability to have *full* decentralization, without having to make any tradeoffs. We have scaled Ethereum enough to be able to afford to write on blockchain directly and use Ethereum as our Data Availability layer.

Paper is simply a collection of contracts that can be deployed on any EVM-compatible chain. It's simple, just the way things should be.

This makes paper the most secure, permanent and decentralized social network **in the world** from day 1.

As we continue to scale Ethereum L1 and L2s, Paper simply becomes cheaper to post on, without sacrificing on security or decentralization.

## Getting Started

Ready to explore? Here's how to begin:

1. **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)** - Understand how Paper is built

2. Star paper on **[GitHub](https://github.com/on-paper/ink)**

3. Join our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/VQ72d2yHge)**

4. Chat with us on **[Telegram](https://t.me/cartel_sh)**

It's incredibly early, but we're continuously improving to make Paper the base layer for the next-generation decentralized social.
