# Architecture

Paper is powered by the following protocols:

- [Ethereum Comments Protocol (ECP)](/docs/protocols/ecp), ensures your discussions are permanent and uncensorable.
- [Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP)](/docs/protocols/efp), secures your connections and allows you to take them with you across the decentralized web.
- [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](/docs/protocols/ens), powers your identity across the decentralized web.

## Posts
The posts on [ECP](/docs/protocols/ecp) are stored **directly on-chain** inside the blocks. 

Attachments inside the posts (images, videos, etc.) are stored on decentralized storage networks.  
Currently we use [Grove](https://lens.xyz/docs/storage), with IPFS and Arweave coming in the future.

## Identity
Your identity is powered by [ENS](/docs/protocols/ens), which is a decentralized naming system for Ethereum addresses.
It's stored **directly on-chain**.

## Connections
Your connections are powered by [EFP](/docs/protocols/efp), which is a decentralized follow protocol.
It's stored **directly on-chain**.
