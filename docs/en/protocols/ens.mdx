# Your Identity on Paper

Think of ENS like your universal username for the decentralized web - one name that works everywhere, not just on Paper.

<Callout type="info">
**TLDR**: ENS turns complex wallet addresses into simple usernames like `alice.eth`. It's like having a phone contact name instead of memorizing a 42-character phone number.

## What ENS Does for You

Imagine if you had to remember this to find your friend: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1`

With ENS, you just need to remember: `alice.eth`

That's it. ENS is like the contact list in your phone - you don't memorize phone numbers anymore, you just search for "Mom" or "John". Similarly, ENS lets you use simple names instead of complex crypto addresses.

## Why Paper Chose ENS

We didn't create our own username system. Instead, we use ENS because:

### 1. **It Works Everywhere**
Your `.eth` name isn't just for Paper - it works across 100+ other apps and services. It's like having one username that automatically works on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and every other platform.

### 2. **You Own Your Identity**
Unlike traditional social media where the platform controls your username, you truly own your ENS name. No one can take it away or ban it.

### 3. **It's Already the Standard**
ENS is the most widely recognized naming system in web3. When you tell someone your `.eth` name, they instantly know how to find you - whether on Paper or anywhere else.

## How It Works in Paper

When you connect to Paper with your wallet:

1. **Your Profile Appears Automatically** - If you have an ENS name, that becomes your username
2. **Your Avatar Syncs** - Set a profile picture once in ENS, and it appears everywhere
3. **Friends Can Find You** - Others can search for your `.eth` name to discover your profile
4. **Verified Identity** - Your ENS name proves you're the real owner of that identity

<Callout type="success">
**The Beauty of ENS**: Change your profile picture or details in one place, and it updates across every app that uses ENS - including Paper.
</Callout>

## Real-World Example

Let's say you're **sarah.eth**:

- On Paper, you're `@sarah.eth`
- Someone can send you crypto to `sarah.eth`
- Your friend can find you by searching "sarah.eth"
- You can prove you're the real Sarah by owning that ENS name
- If you update your avatar on ENS, it changes on Paper automatically

All from one simple name that you control.

## Getting Started

### Already Have an ENS Name?
Just connect your wallet to Paper, and your profile is ready to go!

### Don't Have One Yet?
You can still use Paper with your wallet address. Consider getting an ENS name when you're ready - it makes everything easier and more social.

**Note**: ENS names do make you less anonymous since they're publicly linked to your wallet. Consider this based on your privacy preferences.
