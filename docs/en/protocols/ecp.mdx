# ECP: Posts You Own

ECP (Ethereum Comments Protocol) lets you create posts that live on the blockchain, not locked to any single platform.

<Callout type="info">
**TLDR**: Your posts become portable data that no platform can delete or censor.

## What is ECP?

ECP is a protocol for storing posts directly on the blockchain. Any post you make through ECP can be read by any compatible app, creating a shared conversation layer across the web.

On traditional platforms, posts are stored on company servers. Platform goes down or bans you, posts disappear.  
With ECP, posts are stored onchain permanently. They travel with you across apps.

## Why Paper Chose ECP

### True Ownership
Your posts are stored on the blockchain. No one can delete them, edit them, or hide them without your permission.

### Flexible Moderation
Communities can set their own rules while users maintain ownership of their content.

## How Posts Are Stored

1. **You write a post** on Paper
2. **Paper signs it** with your approval (gasless)
3. **Stored onchain** - The post is written to the blockchain
4. **Indexed instantly** - Available across all ECP apps
5. **Permanent record** - Can't be deleted by platforms

## Example

When alice.eth creates a post on Paper:
- The post is stored onchain
- Other ECP apps instantly see it
- Even if Paper shuts down, the post remains
- alice.eth always owns and controls her post

## Getting Started

Simply post on Paper as usual. Behind the scenes, your posts are being stored on the blockchain through ECP.
