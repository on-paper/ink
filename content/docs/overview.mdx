# Paper

Paper is a minimalistic decentralized social platform that leverages Ethereum's ecosystem to create a censorship-resistant, user-owned social experience. Built with modern web technologies and blockchain protocols, Paper provides a seamless bridge between Web2 user experience and Web3 ownership principles.

## Key Features

  <Card title="Decentralized Identity" description="Powered by ENS (Ethereum Name Service) for human-readable addresses and profiles" />
  <Card title="Social Graph" description="Built on EFP (Ethereum Follow Protocol) for portable, user-owned social connections" />
  <Card title="On-chain Comments" description="Using ECP (Ethereum Comments Protocol) for permanent, decentralized discussions" />
  <Card title="Gasless Transactions" description="Seamless UX with sponsored transactions for approved users" />

## Why Paper?

Traditional social platforms control your data, relationships, and content. Paper changes this paradigm:

- **True Ownership**: Your profile, posts, and connections are yours forever
- **Censorship Resistance**: Content stored on IPFS/Arweave cannot be deleted
- **Portable Identity**: Take your social graph anywhere
- **Open Protocol**: Built on open standards that anyone can interact with

## Technology Stack

Paper combines cutting-edge Web3 protocols with modern development practices:

### Blockchain Layer
- **ENS**: Decentralized naming and identity
- **EFP**: Social graph management
- **ECP**: Comment protocol with signless approvals
- **Ethereum**: Settlement layer for ownership

### Storage Layer
- **IPFS**: Distributed content storage
- **Arweave**: Permanent data archival
- **Lens Files**: Structured data management

### Application Layer
- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Wagmi/Viem**: Ethereum interactions
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management

## Getting Started

<Callout type="info">
Paper is currently in beta. Some features may be experimental or subject to change.
</Callout>

### For Users

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
2. Set up your ENS name (optional but recommended)
3. Start posting and interacting with the community

### For Developers

bun install

# Run development server
bun run dev
```

## Architecture Overview

Paper follows a modular architecture that separates concerns:

- **Frontend**: Next.js application with responsive UI
- **Smart Contracts**: Minimal on-chain logic for critical functions
- **Storage**: Hybrid approach using IPFS for content and Arweave for permanence
- **Indexing**: Graph Protocol for efficient data queries
