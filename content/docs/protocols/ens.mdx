# ENS Integration

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is the foundation of identity in Paper, providing human-readable names for Ethereum addresses and decentralized profile management.

## Overview

ENS transforms complex addresses like `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1` into readable names like `alice.eth`. In Paper, ENS serves as:

- **Primary Identity**: User profiles are built on ENS names
- **Avatar System**: Profile pictures via ENS metadata
- **Discovery Mechanism**: Find users by their ENS names
- **Verification Badge**: ENS ownership proves identity
